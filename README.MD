Authors: Carl Vincent V. Pua and Joseph Anthony C. Hermocilla

Abstract— Students’ Organization in University of the Philippines Los Baños (UPLB) use Google Drive in managing and sharing files of their organization. However, there is a challenge when managing the files in the Shared with me due to its interface and what the students usually share. The sharing option is also limited to Restricted, Within the University of the Philippines, and Anyone which makes it hard if an organization wants to share a file within the organization only. Disk-O aims to solve this by making a new interface of Shared with me and implementing roles and its permissions. The average scores on Post-Study System Usability Questionnaire (PSSUQ) version 3 were 2.34 in System Usefulness, 2.29 in Information Quality, 2.16 in Interface Quality and 2.26 in Overall. All of the respondents agreed that the implementation of roles and its permissions is useful.
